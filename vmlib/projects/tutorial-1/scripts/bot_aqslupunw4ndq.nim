# Welcome to Enu!

Enu is a 3D world where you can code and create almost anything using a
programming language called [Nim](https://nim-lang.org). It's a place to make
games, experiment, and learn to code. You're using an early prototype that's
missing important features and is full of bugs, but it's getting better quickly.
Please contact me at [dsrw@me.com](mailto:dsrw@me.com) if you have any questions
or suggestions.

In this tutorial you'll learn to move and do some simple coding. In later
tutorials we'll make towers, tunnels, characters, and will finish with a 3D
survival game called `Inky: Isolation`.

Move with the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys, or with the left stick of your game
controller. Look around with the mouse, trackpad, or right stick of your game
controller.

You can close this window by pressing `ESC` on your keyboard or `B` on your
controller, and can come back at any time by clicking on the text block next to
the `Bot`. You can also move without closing the window by using your
controller, or by holding down `alt/option (⌥)` on your keyboard.

Sneak behind the `Bot` to continue the tutorial.

# Jumping and Flying

Jump with the `space` bar, or the `A` button on your game controller.

Fly by jumping twice quickly. Fly upwards by holding the jump button, and
downwards by holding crouch (`C` on the keyboard or `B` on a game controller).
Return to the ground by pressing the `jump` button twice.

Flying is a great way to see things from a better angle and to zip around your
world at high speed. It also lets you move through objects and blocks, so if you
ever get yourself stuck you can probably fly your way out.

Jump, fly, then returning to the ground to continue the tutorial.

# Changing tools

Tools are selected from the `Tool Bar` on the bottom of the screen.

Change tools with the keyboard keys `1` - `8`, the `L1` and `R1` controller
buttons, or by releasing the mouse with `ESC` and selecting a tool with the
mouse pointer.

Enu currently has 8 tools. Tool `1` on the left is the `Code` tool. It can
program almost anything in Enu, and will be explained in more detail later.
Tool `8` on the right is the `Place Bot` tool. Use it to fill your world with
friendly robots. Tools `2` - `7` are the `blue`, `red`, `green`, `black`,
`white`, and `brown` colored blocks.

Select the `Place Bot` tool to continue the tutorial.

`Bots` are NPCs in Enu, and can be programmed to explore, change their

# Coding Enu

We control Enu using [Nim](https://nim-lang.org), a powerful programming
language that's useful for a wide variety of tasks. Almost everything in Enu
can be coded with Nim. Let's start by teaching our `Bot` to walk to the end of
the course.

# Coding Bots

We control the bot with simple commands like `forward` and `turn`. Here's some
code to get our `Bot` partway through the course:

```nim
forward 17
turn right
forward 10
turn left
```

Please finish the code to get the `Bot` get to the end of the course.

Run your code by pressing `alt/option (⌥)`. Keep `alt/option (⌥)` held down to
move around while you're coding. Flying is a great way to get yourself into
position so you can better see what's happening, so try double jumping to get a
better view.

If your `Bot` is moving too slowly for your tastes, make her run by setting the
`speed` value.

```nim
speed = 10

forward 17
turn right
forward 10
turn left
```

Good luck! We'll conclude this tutorial when your `Bot` goes past the
`FINISH HERE!` sign at the end of the course.

# Great Job!

Good work! You learned the basics of Enu, and you coded your first robot.
There's a lot more to come. Everything here - the signs, the course, the giant
spinning confetti monster, were created with `Nim` code inside Enu, and we'll
cover how to do all of it in future tutorials.

This is supposed to be where you move to the next tutorial, but it hasn't been
written yet. For now, click [HERE](<nim://player.god = true;sign.open = false>)
to turn on `God Mode`, which will let you see and modify the code for this
tutorial. It's a bit of a mess, but some folks might find it interesting. Or
click [HERE](<nim://press_action("next_world")>) to load `Inky: Isolation`, a
simple game written in Enu that's loosley inspired by **Alien: Isolation**, but
features Inky, the blue ghost from Pac-Man.

Contact me at [dsrw@me.com](mailto:dsrw@me.com) if you have any questions or
suggestions. Thanks for trying Enu!
